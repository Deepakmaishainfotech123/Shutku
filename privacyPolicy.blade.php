                                the request is the consumer about whom we have collected information, we will verify your
                                identity by matching the identifying information provided by you in the request to the
                                Personal Information that we already maintain about you. As a part of this process, you will
                                be required to provide your name and email address, and mobile number (if the same have been
                                voluntarily provided by you at the time of registering on the Platform or otherwise while

                                explain why we have no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the

                                identified in this Policy. If you use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a
                                request to delete, we may require you to (1) provide the authorized agent with signed
                                permission to do so; (2) verify your identity directly with us; and (3) directly confirm
